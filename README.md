- 👋 Hi, I’m @najwazmri
- 👩🏻‍🎓 A new software engineering student eager to      learn, explore, and build! 
- 🌿 I'm passionate about coding, problem-solving, and understanding the foundations of software development.
- 🎨 Day by day, I write code as a software engineering student. By night, I bring ideas to life as a part-time designer. Balancing both worlds keeps me learning and growing!
